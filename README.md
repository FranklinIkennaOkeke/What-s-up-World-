# WhatÂ´s-up-World-
Creating my fst program in this new Github account

My name is Franklin Ikenna Okeke
I am a CS student 
Currently studying in my fourth language 
I like listening to musics (mostly country, classical. Are&Be etc.(can listening to anything except noisy musics like hard metal and rock)), cooking, travelling, building things and fixing them, reading, etc. 
I guess that all for now.
